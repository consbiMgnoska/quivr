The stock firmware is based on Android 8.1.0 Oreo and has the build number G610FXXU1CRL3 for the Indian region. You can check the full list of firmware versions for different regions and carriers on [SamMobile](https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-j7-prime/firmware/) [^1^] or [SamFw](https://samfw.com/firmware/SM-G610F) [^2^]. You will need to register an account on these websites to download the firmware files.
 
Before you proceed with the installation process, make sure you have backed up all your important data, as this will erase everything on your device. You will also need a Windows PC, a USB cable, and the latest version of Samsung USB drivers installed on your PC. You can download the drivers from [here](https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html).
 
Follow these steps to download and install the official Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime SM-G610F stock rom:
 
1. Download the firmware file for your device from SamMobile or SamFw. The file size will be around 2 GB and it will be in a zip format.
2. Extract the zip file using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get four files: AP, BL, CP, and CSC.
3. Download and install [Odin](https://odindownload.com/), a tool that allows you to flash firmware on Samsung devices.
4. Run Odin as administrator on your PC and click on the BL button. Browse and select the BL file from the extracted firmware folder.
5. Similarly, click on the AP, CP, and CSC buttons and select the corresponding files from the firmware folder. Make sure you select the CSC file, not the HOME\_CSC file.
6. On Odin, make sure only Auto Reboot and F. Reset Time options are checked. Do not check any other options.
7. Turn off your device and boot it into download mode by pressing and holding Volume Down + Home + Power buttons together for a few seconds. Release the buttons when you see a warning screen and press Volume Up to confirm.
8. Connect your device to your PC using a USB cable. Odin should recognize your device and show a blue or green box with a COM port number.
9. Click on the Start button on Odin to begin the flashing process. Do not disconnect your device or interrupt the process until it is finished.
10. Once the process is completed, Odin will show a PASS message and your device will reboot automatically.
