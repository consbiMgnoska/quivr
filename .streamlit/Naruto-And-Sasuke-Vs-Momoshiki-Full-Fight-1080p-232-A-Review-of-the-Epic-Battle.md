The fight begins when Naruto and Sasuke arrive at the dimension where Momoshiki and his partner Kinshiki have taken Naruto's son Boruto and his teammates. Naruto and Sasuke immediately engage Momoshiki and Kinshiki in combat, using their combined skills and abilities to overwhelm them. Naruto unleashes his Kurama mode, while Sasuke activates his Rinnegan and switches between his six paths techniques. They manage to sever Kinshiki's arm and damage Momoshiki's Rinnegan, forcing them to retreat.
 
However, Momoshiki has a backup plan. He absorbs Kinshiki into his body, transforming into a more powerful form. He then launches a barrage of attacks at Naruto and Sasuke, who struggle to keep up with his speed and power. Momoshiki also uses his Rinnegan to absorb any ninjutsu that Naruto and Sasuke throw at him, making him even stronger. He eventually captures Naruto and prepares to extract his chakra.
 
At this point, Boruto intervenes. He uses his Vanishing Rasengan, a technique that he learned from Sasuke, to hit Momoshiki from behind. The Rasengan is invisible to Momoshiki's Rinnegan, so he cannot absorb it. The attack stuns Momoshiki and frees Naruto from his grasp. Naruto then teams up with Boruto to create a massive Rasengan, while Sasuke distracts Momoshiki with his Susanoo. They deliver the final blow to Momoshiki, destroying him once and for all.
 
The fight between Naruto and Sasuke vs Momoshiki is one of the most epic and memorable battles in the Naruto franchise. It showcases the incredible strength and teamwork of Naruto and Sasuke, as well as the potential and growth of Boruto. It also demonstrates the theme of passing on the will of fire to the next generation, as Naruto and Sasuke entrust Boruto with their legacy.
